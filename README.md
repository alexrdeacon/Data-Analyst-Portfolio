# Alexander Deacon Data Analyst Portfolio

## About
Hello, I'm Alexander, but I go by Alex! I am a former freelancing video editor and graphic designer who has made the transition over to Data Analytics! I have a Bachelor of Arts degree in Media (University at Buffalo), majoring in the production side of media with a minor in sociology. I had worked in media freelancing on the side for the past 2 years, but it was not scratching my itch of advancing within a career. So, after moving to a different state (NY -> PA) I decided to take time to figure out what I truly wanted to do. In previous jobs I have used Excel to analyze data and always enjoyed doing it, but I never knew there was a field for this. After some soul searching I stumbled upon SQL, signed up for the Google Data Analytics course and never looked back! 

This is a repository to showcase my skills in data analytics.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list my data analytics projects and briefly describe the way I analyzed, including programs and skills used.

### [NFL Career Length Analysis](https://github.com/alexrdeacon/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/tree/main/NFL%20Career%20Length%20Analysis)

**Code:** [SQL CODE](https://github.com/alexrdeacon/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/main/NFL%20Career%20Length%20Analysis/NFL%20Career%20Length%20Analysis.sql)

**Description:** The original dataset I found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cviaxmiwnptr/nfl-draft-19702021) contained 15774 records as of May 2021. The data includes 29 columns listing draft year, round, pick, player, postion, age, year retired, their career stats and the college they went to. The project includes the following steps: data cleaning and preprocessing, updating the dataset to the current year (end of 2022 NFL season) and EDA (exploratory data analysis). Using excel, I updated draft years from 2000 to present to get current updated stats, as well as adding 5 more columns of data using calculations and online research (Years_Played, Status, Team, State drafted from and State Abbreviation). You can read more about the cleaning process **here add link and new md file**. I then explored data with SQL and made an interactive dashboard with Tableau.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization.

**Technology:** Excel, SQL, Tableau
