# Alexander Deacon Data Analyst Portfolio

## About
Hello, I'm Alexander, but I go by Alex! I am a former freelancing video editor and graphic designer who has made the transition over to Data Analytics! I have a Bachelor of Arts degree in Media (University at Buffalo), majoring in the production side of media with a minor in sociology. I had worked in media freelancing on the side for the past 2 years, but it was not scratching my itch of advancing within a career. So, after moving to a different state (NY -> PA) I decided to take time to figure out what I truly wanted to do. In previous jobs I have used Excel to analyze data and always enjoyed doing it, but I never knew there was a field for this. After some soul searching I stumbled upon SQL, signed up for the Google Data Analytics course and never looked back! 

This is a repository to showcase my skills in data analytics.
