## About
Hello, I'm Alexander, but I go by Alex! I am a former freelancing video editor and graphic designer who has made the transition over to Data Analytics. I have a Bachelor of Arts degree in Media (University at Buffalo), majoring in production with a minor in sociology. After moving to a different state (NY to PA) I decided to take time to figure out what I truly wanted to do. I have used Excel to analyze data and always enjoyed doing it, but only recently found out you can have a career in it. After some soul searching I stumbled upon SQL, signed up for the Google Data Analytics course and never looked back! I regularly practice my skills with codewars problems, doing personal analytic projects with Tableau, Microsoft SQL Server Management studio and Excel/Google Sheets. You can connect with my at my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexanderrdeacon/).

This is a repository to showcase my skills in data analytics.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list my data analytics projects and briefly describe the way I analyzed, including programs and skills used.

### [NFL Career Length Analysis](https://github.com/alexrdeacon/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/main/NFL%20Career%20Length%20Analysis/NFL_Draft_Career_Length_Analysis.md)

**Code:** [SQL CODE](https://github.com/alexrdeacon/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/main/NFL%20Career%20Length%20Analysis/NFL%20Career%20Length%20Analysis.sql)

**Description:** The original dataset I found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cviaxmiwnptr/nfl-draft-19702021) contained 15774 records as of May 2021. The data includes 29 columns listing draft year, round, pick, player, postion, age, year retired, their career stats and the college they went to. The project includes the following steps: data cleaning and preprocessing, updating the dataset to the current year (end of 2022 NFL season) and EDA (exploratory data analysis). Using excel, I updated draft years from 2000 to present to get current updated stats, as well as adding 5 more columns of data using calculations and online research (Years_Played, Status, Team, State drafted from and State Abbreviation). You can read more about the cleaning process **here add link and new md file**. I then explored data with SQL and made an interactive dashboard with [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/alex7268/viz/NFLCareerLengthTracker/NFLCareerLengthTracker).

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization.

**Technology:** Excel, SQL, Tableau
