## About
Hi, I'm Alexander and I am a Data Analyst. I recently earned my certificate in Data Analytics and I hold a Bachelor of Arts degree in Media (University at Buffalo). 

Since I was young, I have always enjoyed sorting through information and finding ways to bring numbers to life. I would constantly be tinkering with data, whether it was writing custom excel formulas to make scouting reports for players in Madden, or creating calculators to assist in family membersâ€™ pricing for their businesses. Having a problem that needs solving, working through it, and providing solutions is a fun challenge to me.

I have a vast background in multiple fields such as healthcare, quality assurance, graphic design and media production. Knowing how the front end of these processes work has helped me have a fresh and new perspective to translate business questions into digestible and useful insights. You can connect with me at my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexanderrdeacon/).

This is a repository to showcase my skills in data analytics.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list my data analytics projects and briefly describe the way I analyzed, including programs and skills used.

### [NFL Career Length Analysis](https://github.com/alexrdeacon/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/main/NFL%20Career%20Length%20Analysis/NFL_Draft_Career_Length_Analysis.md)

**Code:** [SQL CODE](https://github.com/alexrdeacon/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/main/NFL%20Career%20Length%20Analysis/NFL%20Career%20Length%20Analysis.sql)

**Description:** The original dataset I found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cviaxmiwnptr/nfl-draft-19702021) contained 15774 records as of May 2021. The data includes 29 columns listing draft year, round, pick, player, postion, age, year retired, their career stats and the college they went to. The project includes the following steps: data cleaning and preprocessing, updating the dataset to the current year (end of 2022 NFL season) and EDA (exploratory data analysis). Using excel, I updated draft years from 2000 to present to get current updated stats, as well as adding 5 more columns of data using calculations and online research (Years_Played, Status, Team, State drafted from and State Abbreviation). You can read more about the cleaning process **here add link and new md file**. I then explored data with SQL and made an interactive dashboard with [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/alex7268/viz/NFLCareerLengthTracker/NFLCareerLengthTracker).

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization.

**Technology:** Excel, SQL, Tableau
